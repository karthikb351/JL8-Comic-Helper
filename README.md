# JL8 Comic Helper

Firstly, [JL8](http://jl8comic.tumblr.com/aboutcomic) is one of my favorite webcomics, but I tend to read my comics on my tablet, so this downloads the latest comics and bundles it into a CBZ file.


## Usage

Install the requirements
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run ```python main.py```, it should do the rest.

To delete and start afresh, delete the following files and folders
```
- jl8-comics/
- dist/
- shelve.db
```
